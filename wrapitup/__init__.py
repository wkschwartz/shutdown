r"""
This package facilitates interrupting slow code with signals and time limits.

Scripts can request that long running processes gracefully exit, or :dfn:`shut
down` by calling :func:`request`. Those long running processes can
:dfn:`listen`, thereby becoming :dfn:`listeners`, by querying :func:`requested`
occasionally. Scripts can also pass listeners time limits, which the listeners
can track with :class:`Timer` instances; since those instances also check for
requests to shut down, listeners can encapsulate all their listening directly
via :class:`Timer`'s :meth:`Timer.remaining` and :meth:`Timer.expired` methods.

Scripts can allow users to interrupt listeners using :mod:`signal`\ s or Ctrl+C
via :func:`catch_signals`. It returns a context manager inside of which the
receipt of specified signals triggers :func:`request`.

Example
^^^^^^^

A typical use of this package might look like the following.

.. code-block:: python
	:caption: :file:`my_script.py`
	:linenos:

	import wrapitup
	from my_library import a_lot_of_work
	with wrapitup.catch_signals():
		a_lot_of_work(data, time_limit)

.. code-block:: python
	:caption: :file:`my_library.py`
	:name: my_library
	:linenos:
	:emphasize-lines: 5

	import wrapitup
	def a_lot_of_work(data, time_limit):
		timer = wrapitup.Timer(time_limit)
		for datum in data:
			if timer.expired():
				break
			do_work(datum)

Then ``timer.expired()`` in :ref:`my_library` will be :py:const:`True`, and
break out of the :keyword:`for` loop, upon the earlier of

#. the time limit having run out or
#. the process receiving a Ctrl+C or similar signal.

.. note::

	The request API --- :func:`request`, :func:`requested`, and :func:`reset`
	--- is thread safe, but :func:`catch_signals` must be called from the `main
	thread only <https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signals-and-
	threads>`_. :class:`Timer` instances require external synchronization if you
	want to rely on their timing features.

	Upon receipt of one of the signals in ``signals``, :func:`catch_signals`
	calls :func:`request`, replaces the remaining signal handlers with those
	installed before :func:`catch_signals`, and finally calls ``callback``.

	When the context manager exits the :keyword:`with` block, or when any of the

	installed before the block started will be reinstalled unconditionally. When
	the :keyword:`with` block exits, the value returned by :func:`requested`
	will be returned unconditionally to its value before entrance to the
	:keyword:`with` block.

		:func:`catch_signals` must be used from the `main thread only
		<https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signals-and-threads>`_,
		or it will raise a :exc:`ValueError`. Note that if you're running
		listeners in multiple threads started in the :keyword:`with` block, you
		must join them in the same block or there will be a race between
		uninstalling the signal handlers and finishing the listeners.

	.. note::

		On Windows, only processes attached to a console session can receive
		Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break events, which are the only signals Python really
		[supports on Windows](https://bugs.python.org/msg260201). To check
		whether the current process is attached to a console, import
		:mod:`sys`. ``sys.__stderr__.isatty()`` returns whether the process is
		attached to a console.

	:param signals: Signals to listen for. The default includes
		:const:`signal.SIGINT`, which Ctrl+C sends and normally causes Python
		to raise a :exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`. On Windows, ``signals`` must
		contain no signals other than :const:`signal.SIGINT` or
		:const:`signal.SIGBREAK`.
	:param callback: Called from within the installed signal handlers with the
		arguments that the Python :mod:`signal` system passes to the handler.
		The default, used if the argument is :const:`None`, logs the event at
		the :const:`logging.WARNING` level to the logger whose name is this
		module's ``__name__``.

		arguments.

		if ``signals`` is empty, or, on Windows, if ``signals`` contains
		signals other than those allowed.
