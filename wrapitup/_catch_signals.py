class catch_signals:
	r"""Return a context manager to catch signals to request listeners to shut down.

	Upon entrance to the context manager, a message at the :const:`logging.INFO`
	level is written to the logger whose name is this module's
	:const:`__package__` advising which signals are being listend for. Entrance
	to the context manager `returns
	<https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__enter__>`_
	nothing and thus binds nothing but :const:`None` to the target of
	:keyword:`as <with>`.

	Upon receipt of one of the signals in ``signals``, :func:`catch_signals`
	calls :func:`request`, replaces the remaining signal handlers with those
	installed before :func:`catch_signals`, and finally calls ``callback``.

	When the context manager exits the :keyword:`with` block, or when any of the
	installed handlers catches its corresponding signal, all the signal handlers
	installed before the block started will be reinstalled unconditionally. When
	the :keyword:`with` block exits, the value returned by :func:`requested`
	will be returned unconditionally to its value before entrance to the
	:keyword:`with` block.

	:func:`catch_signals` instances are `reentrant and reusable
	<https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#single-use-reusable-and-reentrant-context-managers>`_.
	However, keep in mind that signals and the state of :func:`requested` are
	global.

	Availability: Unix (including macOS and Linux), Windows.

	.. note::

		:func:`catch_signals` must be used from the `main thread only
		<https://docs.python.org/3/library/signal.html#signals-and-threads>`_,
		or it will raise a :exc:`ValueError`. Note that if you're running
		listeners in multiple threads started in the :keyword:`with` block, you
		must join them in the same block or there will be a race between
		uninstalling the signal handlers and finishing the listeners.

	.. note::

		On Windows, only processes attached to a console session can receive
		Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break events, which are the only signals Python really
		`supports on Windows <https://bugs.python.org/msg260201>`_. To check
		whether the current process is attached to a console, import
		:mod:`sys`. ``sys.__stderr__.isatty()`` returns whether the process is
		attached to a console. The only console that seems to work in the tests
		of :func:`catch_signals` is :program:`cmd.exe`.

	:param signals: Signals from the :mod:`signal` module to listen for. If the
		objects in the iterable are :class:`int`\ s or :class:`str`\ s,
		:func:`catch_signals` attempts to convert them to
		:class:`signal.Signals`. The default includes :const:`~signal.SIGINT`,
		which Ctrl+C sends and normally causes Python to raise a
		:exc:`KeyboardInterrupt`.

		On Windows
			``signals`` must contain no signals other than
			:const:`~signal.SIGINT` or :const:`~signal.SIGBREAK`, the two of
			which are together the default.

		On Unix
			the default is :const:`~signal.SIGINT` and
			:const:`~signal.SIGTERM`. On macOS, :const:`~signal.SIGTERM` is what
			:program:`Activity Monitor` sends to processes when you select a
			program and hit :menuselection:`ðŸ›‘ --> Quit`.

	:param callback: Called from within the installed signal handlers with the
		arguments that the Python :func:`~signal.signal` system passes to the handler,
		except that the ``signum`` argument is converted to type
		:class:`signal.Signals` first. The default, used if the argument is
		:const:`None`, logs the event at the :const:`logging.WARNING` level to
		the logger whose name is this module's :const:`__package__`.
	:raises KeyError: If the :mod:`signal` module does not recognize a string
		signal name in ``signals``.
	:raises TypeError: If ``callback`` isn't a callable taking two positional
		arguments.
	:raises ValueError: If called from a thread other than the main thread, or
		if ``signals`` is empty, or, if ``signals`` contains objects that cannot
		be converted to :class:`~signal.Signals` type, or, on Windows, if
		``signals`` contains signals other than those allowed.
	:return: A context manager to use in a :keyword:`with` block.

	.. versionadded:: 0.2.0
		The *callback* parameter.

	.. versionadded:: 0.3.0
		Windows support.

	.. versionchanged:: 0.3.0
		:func:`catch_signals` became reentrant and reusable.
